                    <h1>Bosun Bill</h1>
                    <p>
                        Bosun Bill was known throughout the port<br/>
                        A truly dreadful pirate who was always getting caught<br/>
                        Not one scheme for stealing he could hatch<br/>
                        'Cause someone would spot the treasure he'd got<br/>
                        And Bill, they'd snatch
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        One day Bill awoke laying on a distant beach<br/>
                        The last of his grog was just out of reach<br/>
                        He groped around with trembling hands<br/>
                        And struck something in the sand
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        He'd stumbled upon a part<br/>
                        Of an ancient chart<br/>
                        Stained and torn, the old map told<br/>
                        The way to find a stash of buried gold
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        So, Bosun Bill set out to find a crew<br/>
                        But everyone he asked repliеd, "I'll never sail with you!"<br/>
                        'Til at last, he pliеd a man with ale<br/>
                        To lend him his craft, a rickety raft<br/>
                        Then Bill set sail
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        All by himself, Bill trembled in the dark<br/>
                        He lost both his boots and his hat to a shark<br/>
                        He followed the chart 'til at last he saw<br/>
                        The gleam of a far off shore<br/>
                        The trail led into a cave, silent as the grave<br/>
                        Bill stood gaping at what he saw<br/>
                        A hoard of treasure piled from roof to floor
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        Bosun Bill stuffed treasure into his sac<br/>k
                        He loaded up the boat, but heard a mighty crack<br/>
                        He'd taken too much plunder when he should have kept it light<br/>
                        The raft and all the gold sank out of sight
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        Bosun Bill let out a terrible curse<br/>
                        He'd had a chance at glory but he'd only come out worse<br/>
                        To this day, he's trapped on the island still<br/>
                        Not very clever, worst pirate ever<br/>
                        It's Bosun Bill
                        </p>
